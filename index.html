                            Hello! My name is Simon. I am currently a senior at Queens College and am studying Computer Science. 
                            For as long as I remember, I have been actively learning how to code different languages ever since I fell in love with coding
                            when I was first introduced in my freshman year of high school. I was learning scratch programming with the introduction of if statements
                            and while loops, being a math fanatic, I remember loving to trace through each iteration of the loop and the satisfaction that arose when I finished
                            calculating a value and ran the program just to see that the value I calculated was indeed correct. Ever since then, I've grown as an individual as well as a
                            programmer, tackling on more advance topics like website development with HTML, CSS, and JS and then to further web development with React.

                            With the help of a fellow developer, we developed our own custom search engine which took websites and parsed their link, title, and description,
                            into 3 main file formats of your choice: CSV, JSON, and XML. The search engine was also able to revert those formats back into a readable list to
                            be outputted back to the user interface.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            As a school project, my group decided to make a game hub in which we allowed users to play some of their favorite arcade games like pong.
                            We made it so that the user's score can be put into a database and they can compete with other users. To achieve this, we made a login authentication
                            with user tokens and only once the user is logged in, are they able to update their score to the database.

                            Made a clicking game with react where it contained 12 images and the objective of the game was to test the user's memory
                            and click cards that the user never clicked before.

                                <p>My first interest includes playing handball. This is a sport specific to mainly New York and I have been playing ever since 
                                    the 6th Grade. On my free time outside of coding, playing handball helps a good deal in me maintaining my health.

                                <p>My other interest includes playing the piano. Ever since I was a child in middle school I've always wanted to play the piano because
                                   I loved how tranquil the notes felt whenever I listened to compositions on my spotify. Being more of a want than a need however, I 
                                   didn't receive my first piano until I was in my junior year of high school where my family really went the extra mile and bought me 
                                   an electric piano for my birthday and ever since, I fell in love with playing the piano and memorizing new songs.

                                <h5>Riddles</h5>
                                <p>I feel that since I fell in love with coding, there must be something about coding that piques my interests. Only then did I put the pieces
                                   together and figured that I love coding because coding is like solving a puzzle or a riddle. You are presented with a problem and by using
                                   deductive reasoning, only then will you be able to solve the problem. Riddles are the same as coding where to solve the problem, you would
                                   need a bit of common sense and a lot of reasoning to achieve a satisfying result.
